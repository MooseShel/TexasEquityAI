# TexasEquityAI — Report Enhancement Roadmap

## Tier 1 — Highest Value (AI Differentiators)

### 1. AI Comp-by-Comp Photo Comparison Grid ✅ COMPLETE
Fetch Google Street View images for the subject AND every comparable, then run the Vision Agent on each one. Add a new page showing side-by-side photos with AI-detected condition notes. Visual proof is the #1 factor in ARB hearings.

### 3. Protest Strength Score & Win Probability ✅ COMPLETE
Add an AI confidence meter showing estimated win probability and projected reduction range based on the strength of comparable evidence, sales data, and condition findings.

### 4. Valuation Trend & Forecast Page ✅ COMPLETE
Plot the 4-year valuation history showing the subject's assessment growth vs. the county median. Show percentage changes and projected future values at current trend rates.

## Tier 2 — Strong Differentiators

### 5. FEMA Flood Zone & Environmental Risk Page ✅ COMPLETE
Integrate FEMA flood zone data as an external obsolescence deduction factor. Show flood zone designation, special hazard areas, and calculated depreciation impact.

### 6. Permit & Renovation Cross-Reference ✅ COMPLETE
Cross-reference building permits for subject AND comps. Flag comps with unreflected renovations that make them under-assessed relative to actual condition.

### 7. Neighborhood Market Analysis Page ✅ COMPLETE
Show median sale price, sale-to-assessed ratio, and days-on-market trends for the neighborhood. Quantify market softening as an external obsolescence argument.

### 8. Cost Approach Validation ✅ COMPLETE
Use grade, year built, and building area to calculate replacement cost minus depreciation (Marshall & Swift method). Compare to district's assessed value for an independent cost-approach argument. Cites Texas Tax Code Sec. 23.011.

## Tier 3 — Polish & Professionalism

### 9. Executive Summary Dashboard ✅ COMPLETE
Replace plain text Opinion of Value with a visual dashboard showing traffic-light indicators for each method, comparative bar chart, and one-line recommendation.

### 10. QR Code for Digital Evidence ✅ COMPLETE
Add a QR code on the cover page linking to an online version of the report. Scannable by ARB members for instant access to digital evidence.

### 11. Texas Tax Code Legal Narrative ✅ COMPLETE
Formal protest narrative page follows Texas legal form: "BEFORE THE APPRAISAL REVIEW BOARD", numbered grounds citing Sec. 41.41(a), 41.43(b)(1), 41.43(b)(3), 42.26(a)(3), 23.01, 23.011, 23.012, and 1.04(7). Includes signature block.
