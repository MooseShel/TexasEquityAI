## 3. The Data Quality Cornerstone 🏗️

Data quality is our moat. Here's an honest assessment and improvement roadmap:

### Current Data Issues

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| RentCast AVM values ≠ actual sales prices | Weakens sales comp arguments | 🔴 Critical |
| Missing `year_built` in some bulk records | KNN loses a feature dimension | 🟡 Medium |
| Zero-area properties slip through to comps | Bad equity calculations | 🟡 Medium |
| No historical valuation data per-property | Can't show multi-year trend from *actual* records | 🟡 Medium |
| Stale neighbor cache (no TTL/refresh) | Outdated comp pools | 🟠 High |

### Data Quality Improvements

#### 3A. Actual Sales Data Pipeline 🔴
**The Problem**: Texas is a non-disclosure state — we rely on RentCast AVMs (estimates), not real transaction prices. Ownwell claims "proprietary data."

**The Solution — Build a Multi-Source Sales Intelligence Layer:**
1. **HCAD Deed Records** — HCAD publishes `real_acct.txt` but also `deeds.txt` with recorded sale prices from deed filings → **Free, bulk, authoritative**
2. **County Clerk Deed Records** — Harris County Clerk has a public document search → scrape deed transfer amounts
3. **Zillow/Redfin Sold Listings** — Public "recently sold" pages have *actual* closing prices
4. **RealEstateAPI ATTOM** — Already integrated; mine `lastSalePrice` + `lastSaleDate` fields more aggressively

> [!TIP]
> **Feasibility**: High — HCAD deed files are downloadable alongside real_acct.txt. This single addition would give us **actual sale prices for ~60-70% of properties** in Harris County.

#### 3B. Historical Valuation Timeline 🟡
Import prior-year HCAD bulk data (2020-2024) to build per-property valuation history directly from assessment records, not scraped HTML.

#### 3C. Data Freshness & Validation Engine 🟠
- Add `last_updated` timestamp to all cached records
- Background job to refresh records older than 90 days
- Data confidence score per-property (how many sources confirmed each field)

## 4. 🌟 WOW Factor Features — AI/ML Innovations

### Tier 1 — Game Changers (High Impact, Buildable)

---

#### 🧠 4.1 AI Neighborhood Anomaly Detector
**What**: ML model that scans entire neighborhoods to flag statistical outliers — properties assessed significantly higher than their physical peers.

**How**:
- Train a lightweight anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest or DBSCAN) on the 600K+ HCAD records
- Features: `value_per_sqft`, `building_area`, `year_built`, `state_class`, `neighborhood_code`
- Automatically flag the top 5% most over-assessed properties per neighborhood
- Present to user: *"Your property is assessed 23% higher than the neighborhood median for properties of similar size and age"*

**Why It's a WOW**: No competitor does proactive anomaly detection. Homeowners currently have to *guess* they're overtaxed. We can **tell them**.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — We already have the data in Supabase and sklearn imported. Could build in 1-2 days.

---

#### 📸 4.2 AI Condition Delta Score (Subject vs. Comps)
**What**: Quantified condition comparison between subject and each comparable, not just text — a numeric **Condition Delta** from the Vision Agent.

**How**:
- Run vision analysis on both subject AND each equity comp
- Score each property 1-100 on: Roof, Foundation, Exterior, Landscaping
- Calculate delta: *"Subject scores 62/100 vs. Comp #3 at 89/100 → Comp is in SUPERIOR condition, $14,200 adjustment warranted"*
- Display as a visual radar chart in the PDF

**Why It's a WOW**: ARB panels respond to visual, quantified evidence. No competitor produces condition *scores* with photo proof.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Vision Agent already runs on comps; need to standardize scoring output + add radar chart to PDF.

---

#### 🗺️ 4.3 Geo-Intelligence Layer (Locational Obsolescence Engine)
**What**: Automatically detect property-specific locational disadvantages that reduce value but aren't captured in simple equity analysis.

**AI/ML Detections**:
| Factor | Data Source | Detection Method |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| High-voltage power lines within 500ft | OpenStreetMap / aerial imagery | Geospatial buffer query + Vision AI |
| Adjacent to major highway (noise) | OSM road classification | Distance calculation from property centroid |
| Near industrial/commercial zoning | County zoning shapefiles | GIS overlay |
| Flood plain (already have) | FEMA NFHL | ✅ Done |
| Railroad proximity | OSM railway data | Buffer distance |
| Cell towers within 1,000ft | FCC antenna database | Radius search |
| Registered sex offenders nearby | Public registry | API query |

**Why It's a WOW**: This is the "Google Maps intelligence" layer. Show it as a heatmap on the property page — *"3 negative locational factors detected within 0.25 miles."*

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — OSM data is free. Most of this is geospatial math + one Vision AI call on aerial/satellite imagery.

---

#### 🤖 4.4 AI Hearing Coach ("Your Personal ARB Advisor")
**What**: An interactive AI chatbot trained specifically on Texas property tax law, ARB procedures, and our report data. The homeowner can ask questions like:
- *"What should I say if the appraiser brings up my renovations?"*
- *"How do I respond to the argument that my comps are too far away?"*
- *"What's the strongest point in my report?"*

**How**:
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over:
  - Texas Tax Code Sections 23, 41, 42
  - The user's specific generated report data
  - A knowledge base of common ARB hearing scenarios + winning strategies
- Exposed as a chat widget in the Streamlit app

**Why It's a WOW**: Ownwell sends someone to the hearing *for you*. We **empower** the homeowner to win *themselves* — with a personal AI coach that knows their exact case.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — LangChain RAG is well-established. We have the Gemini/OpenAI keys. Main work is building the knowledge base.

---

### Tier 2 — Strong Differentiators

---

#### 📊 4.5 Predictive Tax Savings Estimator
**What**: ML model that predicts *how much savings you'll actually get* based on historical protest outcomes for similar properties.

**How**:
- Collect historical protest outcome data (HCAD publishes hearing results)
- Train a regression model on: property type, neighborhood, initial vs. final value, year
- Show: *"Properties like yours in this neighborhood typically achieve a 12-18% reduction at ARB."*

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐ — Depends on getting historical hearing outcome data. HCAD may publish this.

---

#### 🏘️ 4.6 "One-Click Neighborhood Scan"
**What**: Enter a street name or neighborhood code → instantly analyze ALL properties, rank by over-assessment severity, generate a batch report.

**Use Case**:
- Property tax consultants managing 50+ clients on the same block
- HOA boards that want to protest for the whole subdivision
- Real estate agents advising buyers about tax exposure

**How**: Already have the bulk data. Build a batch processing endpoint + summary dashboard.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Mostly UI/UX work on top of existing capabilities.

---

#### 📱 4.7 Mobile-First Report Viewer
**What**: QR code on the PDF (already done!) links to a rich, interactive web report — not just a static page but an *interactive dashboard* with:
- Zoomable comp map
- Expandable photo comparisons
- Shareable link for attorneys/consultants

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Would need a lightweight web viewer, but we have all the data.

---

#### 🔔 4.8 Annual Assessment Monitor & Alert System
**What**: Users register their property → we auto-check when new assessment values are published → send an alert: *"Your 2027 assessment increased 14%. Based on our analysis, you have a strong case for protest."*

**How**:
- Background cron job compares Supabase records against new HCAD bulk data each year
- Email/SMS notification when assessment change exceeds a threshold
- One-click "Generate My Protest Report" from the alert

**Why It Matters**: Creates recurring engagement. Moves from one-time tool to **annual subscription** model.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Simple data comparison + notification service (SendGrid/Twilio).

---

### Tier 3 — Future Vision

---

#### 🛰️ 4.9 Satellite/Aerial Change Detection
**What**: Compare aerial imagery year-over-year to detect:
- New construction not yet reflected in assessment
- Demolitions or damage
- Pool additions, lot changes

**How**: Google Earth Engine + Vision AI temporal comparison.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐ — Complex but powerful. Long-term roadmap.

---

#### 🏦 4.10 Integration with Tax Lending / Payment Plans
**What**: Partner with property tax lenders to offer "protest + financing" — if protest fails, offer a payment plan.

**Feasibility**: ⭐⭐ — Business development, not just engineering.

---
